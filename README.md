# latex-handout

This is a class for LaTeX handouts styled to have a similar layout to the Tufte handouts, but not as opinionated as the Tufte class. Feel free to use section numbering or not, and change the font to whatever you like. There is space in the right margin for sidenotes. 
Use `\sidenote{}` for sidenotes. Both sidenotes and footnotes can be used.
